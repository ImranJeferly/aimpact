# ðŸš„ Railway Deployment Guide

## Current Status: âœ… READY FOR RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT

Your website is now fully configured for both localhost and Railway deployment with clean URLs.

## Step 1: Railway Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your Railway dashboard:

```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=aimpact-22bcb
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://aimpact-22bcb-default-rtdb-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

## Step 2: URL Compatibility

âœ… **Clean URLs work on both platforms:**
- `yoursite.com/blogs` (instead of `blogs.php`)
- `yoursite.com/contact` (instead of `contact.php`) 
- `yoursite.com/blog?id=123` (blog posts with IDs)

âœ… **Automatic redirects:**
- `.php` URLs redirect to clean URLs
- Prevents duplicate content issues
- Works on both localhost and Railway

## Step 3: .htaccess Features

âœ… **Railway-compatible features:**
- Conditional module loading (only loads if available)
- Fallback for servers without mod_rewrite
- Security headers and file protection
- Compression and caching (if supported)

## Step 4: Firebase Integration

âœ… **Production-ready Firebase:**
- REST API implementation (no gRPC dependency issues)
- Automatic fallback data system
- Compatible with Railway's PHP environment

## Step 5: Testing URLs

**These URLs will work on both localhost and Railway:**

- Homepage: `/` or `/index`
- Blog listing: `/blogs`
- Individual blog: `/blog?id=your-blog-id`
- Contact page: `/contact`
- Thank you page: `/thank_you`
- Search: `/search_blogs?search=keyword`

## Step 6: Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Railway:

1. âœ… Set Firebase environment variables
2. âœ… Complete Firestore database setup (from COMPLETE_FIREBASE_SETUP.md)
3. âœ… Test all URLs work with clean format
4. âœ… Verify Firebase connection is working
5. âœ… Optional: Set up SMTP credentials for contact forms

## Current File Status

âœ… **Updated for Railway compatibility:**
- `.htaccess` - Railway-compatible URL rewriting
- `blog.php` - Uses clean URLs for redirects
- `submit_form.php` - Uses clean URLs for redirects
- `config/url_helper.php` - URL helper functions (optional)

âœ… **Railway deployment files:**
- `.railway.env` - Environment variable reference
- `railway_deployment_guide.md` - This guide

## Error Handling

The website handles both environments gracefully:
- If mod_rewrite isn't available, falls back to .php URLs
- If Firebase isn't configured, uses fallback data
- Clean error pages and proper HTTP status codes
